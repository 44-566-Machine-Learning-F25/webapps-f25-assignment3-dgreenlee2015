        <h2>Game of Thrones</h2>
        <p>
            The show is exciting. I enjoy the <b>fantasy aspect</b> of it also. The drama brings you into the story.
            The <b>story arcs</b> of the characters are interesting.

        <h2>Table of People I would like to meet</h2>
        <p>
            This is a table about people I would like or would have liked to meet. They are actors and authors. I find these people interesting.
            The table shows their name, the reason I would like to meet them, their birthday, and the date of their death (if they have died).
